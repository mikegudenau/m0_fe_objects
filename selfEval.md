# Self-Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?

I felt that the object literals assignment was fairly straight forward. This may be because of all the practice I've been putting in so far. I do know however, that objects do get much more complex. I'm looking forward to more challenges! 


- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?

As I currently write this reflection, I am not at home and I don't have access to my normal work station in my home office. I have found that I really need a proper desk with external monitor. I don't like using only my laptop for work. This shows that I am dependent on my routine space. 

I continue to find that taking 90 minutes to completly emerse myslef into a task is how I work best. Taking breaks are imporant for me but it can be hard to fully get my head out of coding during my 20 minute break. I enjoy my breaks best when I get outside and do come kind of brainless task such as chopping wood, taking out the trash, take out compost, etc.

- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1?

I want to remember that objects can be accessed using dot notation and bracket notation. Each style has its own functionality.

"When working with **dot notation**, property identifies can only be alphanumeric (and _ and $). Properties canâ€™t start with a number."

"When working with **bracket notation**, property identifiers only have to be a String. They can include any characters, including spaces. Variables may also be used as long as the variable resolves to a String. This means there are fewer limitations when working with bracket notation. We can now have spaces in our strings, and can even start strings with numbers."
